# Code HTML Highlighter

The program is a Go application that takes a source code file as input and outputs an HTML file with the source code highlighted. It uses the github.com/d4l3k/go-highlight library, which provides syntax highlighting for many programming languages.

To use the program, you can run it from the command line and provide the path to the source code file as an argument and the programming language as another argument. The program will then read the file, and apply syntax highlighting using HTML tags.

The resulting HTML file need additional CSS styles to display the highlighted code with a color scheme that is easy to read and distinguish different syntax elements. The output can be viewed in a web browser or embedded in other web pages or documents.

The program is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a minimal set of dependencies and configuration options. It provides a convenient way to add syntax highlighting to code samples or snippets in documentation, blog posts, or other online content, without requiring a lot of manual formatting or editing.
